  text: Drift Cascade is a solo endeavor dedicated to the pursuit of high-concept
    ambitious game design. We believe that deep, interwoven mechanics and
    emergent simulation create inherently more compelling experiences than
    pre-scripted narratives. We build the ruleset; players discover the chaos.
    We create the games we want to play, focusing on complex strategy, real-time
    tactics, and innovative top-down systems.
