Fight over crashed starships for valuable salvage, but with a persistent crew, every loss hurts. Destroyed vehicles leave wreckage, and with multiple warring factions you might salvage enough to pay your dropship fees without firing a shot.

Take a look at this early **screenshot gallery**:

## Backstory

**Salvage Wars** is a single-player *roguelite extraction real-time tactics* game where you command a salvage crew picking through battlefields beneath an ongoing orbital war. Each mission, you’ll scavenge high-value gear from wrecked ships, navigate hostile forces, and manage your crew’s survival.

On each deployment, your small crew enters a fresh battlefield to recover what they can. You’re not alone: the local military, wreck survivors, rescue squads, rival scavengers, and bandits are all after the same prize. The longer you stay, the greater the reward, and the danger, creating a press-your-luck loop where greed often meets destruction. Units are persistent across missions, carrying their stats, injuries, and upgrades with them, making every loss meaningful.

Between missions, you can sell salvage, repair units, and upgrade equipment using found or purchased parts. Study which ships are about to make **orbitfall** and choose your next landing site carefully. Higher drop weights mean higher **dropship fees** and less capacity for returning cargo, so plan your deployment crew wisely.
