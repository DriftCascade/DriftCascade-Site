This site is the dedicated website for **Drift Cascade**, my solo development studio.

My focus is strictly on designing games that push the boundaries of **strategy, emergent systems, and real-time tactics**. This site's primary function is to serve as a landing page technical blog for those projects.

### The Name: Drift Cascade Interactive

The studio name reflects the mechanical philosophy behind the games:

* **Drift:** The deviation from a predicted vector. This represents the studio's commitment to designing simulation based gameplay that inevitably veers off course - the calculated error that generates complexity.
* **Cascade:** The unpredictable chain reaction from accumulated errors. The **systemic fallout** in gameplay, where a single input triggers a complex, emergent sequence of events across the simulation.

The studio is driven by one metric: creating the deep, systems-focused games I want to play, prioritizing simulation and function over graphical fidelity.

### A Brief History

My initial foray into game development began over a decade ago, in **2014**, with *CityWar*. That project served as my long-running learning platform for understanding core game systems and the Unity game engine. Developed following the conclusion of my Computer Science degree and a couple years of professional programming under my belt. While ambition was high, the project was never intended to be completed, and scope wasn't even a word in my vocabulary. The current public alpha was a push to wrap things into a playable state as I decide to pursue creating a game intended for release from the start.

The pivot to **Salvage Wars** represents a shift in strategy: taking the deep mechanical knowledge gained from *CityWar* and applying it to a much tighter, narrower design concept optimized for focused development and release.

### Project Status

**Salvage Wars** (hybrid RTS/RTT roguelike extraction tactics) is now the active project, consuming architecture time. I am targeting an **early access / public alpha release near the end of this year**.

*CityWar* is currently on hold, although I have exciting plans for a version two down the line.

I will use this space to share functional progress as the core systems stabilize. Thank you for reading.

Let the systems emerge.
