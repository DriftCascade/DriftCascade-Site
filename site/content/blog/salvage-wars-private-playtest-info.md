## Playtester Instructions

> Note: The download link is sent separately from these instructions

Take a look at the **backstory** below for the basic pitch of the game. This is my vision for the game that I am pretty confident in. However, implementing that vision has thousands of tiny decisions which I would love your feedback on.

The **primary goal** of this playtest is to evaluate the **combat mechanics and their potential to create engaging and diverse tactical situations.** Please focus on the feel of combat gameplay, not polish, as you can expect bugs, jank, and placeholder systems.

**Basic Playtest Guidelines**

* **Focus on Combat:** While basic overworld screens are present, critical gameplay loops (like selling loot or unit upgrades) are missing.  

  * Use the overworld simply to pick forces and experiment with unit compositions.  
  * Choose any wreck from the wreck picker; its stats are currently placeholder.  
* **Single Battle Map:** There's only one battle map with non-randomized enemy spawns for now.  

  * **Main Objective:** Head to the central wreck, clear hostiles, and extract your force (T key).  
  * **Side Objective:** Explore the destroyed tank with an item west of the central wreck.  
  * **Meta Objective:** Try to complete the map with the least investment and/or losses.  
* **Experiment:**  

  * Try out the direct control top-down shooter mode! (Tab to switch between RTS and TDS modes).  
  * Experiment with different unit types.

**Feedback Guidelines: Things to Consider While Playing**

1. Is this fun? Could it be fun?  
2. **Scale:** Zoom level, engagement ranges, and Time to Kill (TTK).  
3. Tactical Variety / Interestingness.  
4. Map and Encounter Design.  
5. RTS / TDS mode (Tab to switch).

## Backstory

Salvage Wars is a single-player extraction real-time tactics game where you command a salvage crew picking through battlefields beneath an ongoing orbital war. Each mission, you'll scavenge high-value gear from wrecked ships, navigate hostile forces, and manage your crew's survival.

On each deployment, your small crew enters a fresh battlefield to recover what they can. You're not alone: the local military, wreck survivors, rescue squads, rival scavengers, and bandits are all after the same prize. The longer you stay, the greater the reward, and the danger, creating a press-your-luck loop where greed often meets destruction. Units are persistent across missions, carrying their stats, injuries, and upgrades with them, making every loss meaningful.

Between missions, you can sell salvage, repair units, and upgrade equipment using found or purchased parts. Study which ships are about to make orbitfall and choose your next landing site carefully. Higher drop weights mean higher dropship fees and less capacity for returning cargo, so plan your deployment crew wisely.

## Roadmap Preview

**Short-Term Plan – End of Year 2025**

1. **Improved Encounter Generation & Variety:**  

   * Randomize opposing forces based on scenario parameters.  
   * Add new, larger maps.  
2. **Salvaging Implementation:**  

   * Enhance UI/UX for in-operation salvaging.  
   * Introduce proper systems for selling loot, purchasing equipment, and unit customization.  
   * Improve Pilot & Infantry management.  
3. **Contracts (Quests) & Faction Relations:**  

   * Potentially include randomized vendors.

**Long-Term Plan**

* **New Combat Mechanics and Equipment:** Details to be determined.  
* **Graphics Update:** Utilize already purchased asset packs for environment design. Revisit unit models and visual effects.  
* **Sounds Update:** Implement unit voice barks and other sfx  
* **Mechs!**  

  * Add Mechs, which were originally core to the game's concept (real-time BattleTech 2018).  
  * Mechs will be highly customizable, durable, and maneuverable units.  
  * This feature was deprioritized to ensure core mechanics are strong independently, with Mechs providing an enhanced experience.  
* **Procedurally Generated Maps:**  

  * Beyond just unit placement, focus on generating the maps themselves.  
  * First, I need to make fun maps without procedural generation.
