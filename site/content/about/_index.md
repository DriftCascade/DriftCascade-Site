## The Mission
Drift Cascade is a solo endeavor dedicated to the pursuit of high-concept ambitious game design. We believe that deep, interwoven mechanics and emergent simulation create inherently more compelling experiences than pre-scripted narratives. We build the ruleset; players discover the chaos. We create the games we want to play, focusing on complex strategy, real-time tactics, and innovative top-down systems.


## The Founder: Michael (Mwalk10)

Drift Cascade is the work of one developer, Michael (Mwalk10), driven by a passion for boundary-pushing concepts and curiosity for gaming technologies. 

Hybrid genre games have always appealed to me, especially ones that did not intend to be hybirds like Planetside and the X series. My background in computer science, math, economics, simulation, and procedural generation inform every project.
