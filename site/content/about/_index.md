Drift Cascade is the work of one developer (Mwalk10), driven by a passion for technical execution and boundary-pushing concepts. Hybrid genre games have always appealed to me, especially ones that did not intend to be hybirds like Planetside and the X series. My background in systems design, simulation, and procedural generation informs every project.
