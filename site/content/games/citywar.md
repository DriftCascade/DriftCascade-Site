### Overview

In CityWar multiple factions fight for control of a city divided into regions. The setting is in an already developed world with an oppressive government regime. Various factions/corporations trade and fight with each other while avoiding the wrath of the police. A trade simulation underpins the economy and unit production in the game, allowing factions to fight economically as well as with military force.
