# Cursor Rules for DriftCascade-Site

## Package Manager
- **Use YARN, not npm** for all package management
- Yarn is often already running in the background with hot reload active, so you do not need to issue yarn built or yarn start.
- Commands: `yarn install`, `yarn build`, `yarn start`, etc.

## Project Structure
- This is a Hugo static site generator project
- Hugo site in `/site/` directory
- Source files in `/src/` directory
- Build output in `/dist/` directory
- Blog posts are in `/site/content/blog/`
- Templates are in `/site/layouts/`
- Static assets are in `/site/static/`

## Development Guidelines
- When adding new features and adjusting rendering, attempt to re-use common partials and components first.
- This site should be responsive for both small, medium, and large screens. (Phone, tablet, desktop)
- Generally, you do not need to create new documentation explaining implementations unless asked to.
